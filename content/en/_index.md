    The Minirhizotron Facility, part of [Forschungszentrum Jülich's](https://www.fz-juelich.de) Institute of Bio- and Geosciences Agrosphere (IBG-3) and the [phenorob CP3](https://www.phenorob.de/cp-3-the-soil-root-zone/) project, focuses on soil-plant interactions and sustainable farming. Using advanced minirhizotron installations and various soil types, the facility offers insights into root development and their response to environmental factors. The research here addresses current agricultural challenges, including climate change and reducing fertilizer use, aligning with the EU farm-to-fork strategy. Through detailed studies and global data sharing via the [TERENO Data Discovery Portal](https://doi.org/10.34731/cg3t-nb88), it contributes to improving crop production and understanding plant growth in varying conditions.

    The Selhausen minirhizotron facility, one of just two in Europe, offers a unique and insightful view into the often unseen world of roots and soil. This facility can collect critical data needed to improve our understanding of how plants respond in agricultural environments:

    - **GPR data** ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.34731/cg3t-nb88)): Data subdivided by year. Each year's folder contains two CSV files for measurements on each facility.
    - **Root data** ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.34731/7x05-2r96)): Available with a DOI, providing a link to a repository.
    - **Root images** ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.34731/5zwe-t974)): Organized by year and facility. Each measurement date has a folder containing all images measured on that date.
    - **Soil sensor data** ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.34731/ffsk-sy65)): Contains one file for each sensor type and facility, corresponding to the year the data were obtained.
    All data were uploaded to Geonetwork in accordance with ISO 19115. The data were persistently stored and will be regularly updated (see [Usage Notes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02570-9)). The data were subdivided according to the characteristics of the sensing method and data type.
